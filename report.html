<h2>About</h2>
<p>This coursework is a quiz on paleontology facts such as might be used by a
teacher or learner on the subject. It utilizes the multilingual and natural
language capabilities of Grammatical Framework for performing the translation
between user input and output and an abstract store of scientific facts (GF
categories).</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<ul>
<li>_<code>paleo.sh</code>_: Shell script, main program</li>
<li>_<code>Paleo.gf</code>_: Abstract syntax for a paleontology domain</li>
<li>_<code>PaleoEng.gf</code>_: English concrete syntax</li>
<li>_<code>PaleoSpa.gf</code>_: Spanish concrete syntax</li>
<li>_<code>facts.db</code>_: Example database of paleontological facts</li>
<li>_<code>REPORT.md</code>_: This document</li>
<li>_<code>REPORT.html</code>_: HTML version of this document</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A working GF installation (<code>gf</code> command)</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Standard modern Linux/UNIX environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04, kernel version 3.13.0-57-generic,
bash version 4.3.11(1)-release</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The entry point of the coursework is the script <code>paleo.sh</code>. It is recommended
that it is executed with a readline wrapper such as <code>rlwrap(1)</code>, but it is not
necessary.</p>
<p>The script provides a prompt through which the user has access to the following
commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>help</code>: gives some information on the commands.</li>
<li><code>add</code>: parses and introduces a new sentence into the fact database, for it to
be used by the quiz.</li>
<li><code>quiz</code>: makes an interactive quiz for the user to solve, asking single-choice
test questions on facts found in the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expert input</h2>
<p>The expert can add paleontological facts to the database via the <code>add</code> command.
This command takes as arguments the natural language fact, either in Spanish or
English.</p>
<p>It then gives the sentence for GF to parse and try to build an abstract syntax
tree. If this process succeeds, the AST is then stored (in a slightly different
format) in the fact database for later perusal.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; add the early amniotes diversified during the Permian
OK
&gt; add los dinosaurios se extinguieron a el final de el Cretácico
OK
&gt; add los dinosaurios se extinguieron hace 65 millones de años
ERROR: sentence not understood
&gt; 
</code></pre>
<h2>Quizzing</h2>
<p>After the fact database is built, the user can ask to be given a quiz. This quiz
is a simple single-choice test with only one question, that is choosing the
correct fact between the different options. The test is inspired by the
translation quiz used as an example for GF, and it uses its random generation
capabilities.</p>
<p>Since the Paleontology Grammar supports two languages (English and Spanish) the
user can choose which language to be asked the questions in (Eng or Spa,
respectively). It does not matter what language the facts were input in, since
only the abstract meaning is stored, and so more languages could be added to
cater to a multilingual audience while still introducing facts in the chosen
language of the instructor.</p>
<p>All questions relate to a single fact, and provide a random listing of four
options, one of them the correct answer, and three other ones where the last
concept has been swapped for a randomly generated, linguistically appropriate
choice made by the GF cli.</p>
<p>The Paleontology Grammar supports two types of structures, one with the period
as the topic and the group as the focus (see section Paleontology Grammar below)
and the other with the two interchanged. That means that the word ordering of
the sentence as presented by the quiz may not be the same every time.</p>
<p>For the moment, only simple questions where the focus of the statement is
randomized are used. If more difficulty was needed, the code could be changed to
randomize more parts of the sentence, or provide more options.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; quiz Eng

: 2
points: 5/6

<h2>Paleontology Grammar</h2>
<p>The paleontology grammar used for this coursework consists of three files, one
for the abstract syntax and one each for the concrete syntax of English and Spanish.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract Syntax *</li>
</ul>
<p>The facts we are interested in for the paleontology quiz are shaped in a very
determinate way. They are facts about events that happened at some point in
life's history, and involved a determinate group of living beings. Thus, we can
identify three main components in our facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The event (called Action in the grammar)</li>
<li>The group of living beings, usually a clade but can also be a qualified term
(linguistically, a nound with an adjective)</li>
<li>The time when the event happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Abstract syntax also allows two shapes for the sentences as explained above
in the previous section.  It is a matter of argument whether the topic/focus
division of natural language should belong to concrete or abstract syntax, but
we choose the latter since for this coursework it makes it easier to generate
the random sentences. It can also be argued that the distinction is actually
semantic, though in our discussion of plain facts for the quiz it is not really
relevant.</p>
<p>The actions and groups don't present further complexity, apart from some actions
(events) being actually functions that can take other elements as arguments. To
further improve the quiz, questions could be made to randomize these embedded
arguments as well. An example of this is the event &quot;EvolveFrom&quot;, which requires
a group to evolve from.</p>
<p>Time, however, is a bit more interesting. Apart from the number of different
periods in geological time, some more precision must be allowed. For example,
ranges have to be accomodated, and specific points such as the beggining of, and
the end of, have to also be taken into account. Not every category can be part
of an interval, and some of them cannot stand alone either. The end result can
be seen near the top of the abstract grammar.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>common sense</li>
<li>numbers</li>
<li>spanish contractions, punctuation</li>
