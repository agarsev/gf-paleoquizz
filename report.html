<h2>About</h2>
<p>This coursework is a quiz on paleontology facts such as might be used by a
teacher or learner on the subject. It utilizes the multilingual and natural
language capabilities of Grammatical Framework for performing the translation
between user input and output and an abstract store of scientific facts (GF
categories).</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<ul>
<li>_<code>paleo.sh</code>_: Shell script, main program</li>
<li>_<code>Paleo.gf</code>_: Abstract syntax for a paleontology domain</li>
<li>_<code>PaleoEng.gf</code>_: English concrete syntax</li>
<li>_<code>PaleoSpa.gf</code>_: Spanish concrete syntax</li>
<li>_<code>facts.db</code>_: Example database of paleontological facts</li>
<li>_<code>REPORT.md</code>_: This document</li>
<li>_<code>REPORT.html</code>_: HTML version of this document</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A working GF installation (<code>gf</code> command)</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Standard modern Linux/UNIX environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04, kernel version 3.13.0-57-generic,
bash version 4.3.11(1)-release</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The entry point of the coursework is the script <code>paleo.sh</code>. It is recommended
that it is executed with a readline wrapper such as <code>rlwrap(1)</code>, but it is not
necessary.</p>
<p>The script provides a prompt through which the user has access to the following
commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>help</code>: gives some information on the commands.</li>
<li><code>add</code>: parses and introduces a new sentence into the fact database, for it to
be used by the quiz.</li>
<li><code>quiz</code>: makes an interactive quiz for the user to solve, asking single-choice
test questions on facts found in the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expert input</h2>
<p>The expert can add paleontological facts to the database via the <code>add</code> command.
This command takes as arguments the natural language fact, either in Spanish or
English.</p>
<p>It then gives the sentence for GF to parse and try to build an abstract syntax
tree. If this process succeeds, the AST is then stored (in a slightly different
format) in the fact database for later perusal.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; add the early amniotes diversified during the Permian
OK
&gt; add los dinosaurios se extinguieron a el final de el Cretácico
OK
&gt; add los dinosaurios se extinguieron hace 65 millones de años
ERROR: sentence not understood
